What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

def fix(value)
  value << 'xyz'
  value = value.upcase
  value.concat('!')
end

s = 'hello'
t = fix(s)

What values do `s` and `t` have? Why?
----

On line 9 local variable `s` is initialized to a string object with the value `'hello'`. On line 10, the `fix` method is invoked and passed in the string object referenced by `s`.

On lines 3 - 7 the `fix` method is defined. The string object referenced by local variable `s` is passed in as the argument in place for the `value` parameter. On line 4, the mutating `#<<` method is called on the string referenced by method local variable `value`, and the string object `xyz` is passed in as an argument. This concatenates `'xyz'` to the end of the string object referenced by method local variable `value` and local variable `s` to the modified value of `'helloxyz'`.

On line 5, the nonmutating `#upcase` method is called on the string oject referenced by `value`. This method makes a copy of the string and converts all letters in the string to their uppercase version. The method local varible `value` is reassigned to the return value of the `#upcase` method call; `'HELLOXYZ'`.`value` and `s` no longer reference the same string object; `value` references string object `'HELLOXYZ'`, and `s` references string object `'helloxyz'`.

On line 6, the mutating `#concat` method is called on the object referenced by `value` passing in string literal `!` as an argument. This mutates the string object referenced by `value` to `'HELLOXYZ!'`. Since this is the last evaluated expression in the method, `'HELLOXYZ!'` is returned by the method. On line 10 `t` is initialized to the return value of the `fix` method invocation; `'HELLOXYZ!'`.

This code demonstrates the concept of pass by value. The return value from the method is a different string object than the one originally passed in as an argument. When the argument is initially passed into the method, both `s` and `value` referenced the same string object. On line 5, in the methods body, a copy is created by a nonmutating method call, and remaining code within the methods affects the copy, not the original.

animal = "dog"

loop do |_|  
  animal = "cat"

end

puts animal
puts var
----

On line 29, local variable `animal` is initialized and assigned to the string `'dog'`. 

On line 31 the `loop` method is invoked and passed in the `do..end` block from lines 31 to 35, with no block parameter assigned. Outer-scoped local variable `animal` is reassigned to a new string `cat` on line 32. On line 33, inner

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

animal = "dog"

loop do |animal| 
  animal = "cat"  
  break
end

puts animal
----
On line 50, local variable `animal` is initialized to the string `dog`. 

On line 52 the `loop` method is invoked and passed in a `do..end` block from lines 52 to 55 as an argument. The block contains 1 block parameter of `animal` which creates a variable shadow to the outer scope local variable `animal`. On line 53, block local variable `animal` is initialized to the string `cat`, and the loop is exited.

On line 57, the `puts` method is invoked and passed in the value referenced by local variable `animal` as an argument. This outputs `dog` and returns `nil`. The value referenced by the outer scope local variable `animal` is not changed on line 53 due to the concept of variable shadowing: When a block parameter (captured between the `||` symbols) has the same variable name as a variable in the outer scope, this PREVENTS access to the outer scoped local variable.

This example demonstrates variable shadowing.  When a block parameter and a local variable initialized in the outer scope share the same name, the outer scoped local variable is shadowed by the block parameter and will not be accessible inside the block.

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }.each_with_object({}) do |(key, value), hash|
  hash[value] = key
end
----
On line 66 the `each_with_object` method is called on the hash `{ a: "ant", b: "bear", c: "cat" }` with an empty hash passed in as an argument. A `do..end` blcok is defined and passed in as an argument to the `each_with_object` method. On each iteration, a key/value pair from `hash`, and the hash object are passed into the block and assigned to `(key, value)` and `hash` repsectively. On line 67, a new key/value pair is added into the `hash` passed in as the argument via the `hash#[]=` method. The value referenced by `value` is assigned as the key, and the value referenced by `key` is assigned as the value for each iteration. Once iteration is completed, the hash which was passed in as an argument is returned; `{ 'ant' => a:, 'bear' => b:, 'cat' => c: }`. There is no output from this code snippet.

This code demonstrates iteration with the `each_with_object` method and how to work with hash collections.

The each_with_object method takes an empty collection as one argument and a block as a second argument returning the collection which was passed in as an argument.  Each element in the calling object is passed into the block being assigned to the first block parameter and the object which is passed in as the argument to the method will be passed into the block being assigned to the second block parameter.  The method will return the newly populated object which was passed in as the argument to the method.

What does the following code return? What does it output? Why? What concept does it demonstrate?

a = 4
b = 2

2.times do |a|
  a = 5
  puts a
end

puts a
puts b
----
On line 77 local variable `a` is initialized to the integer `4`. On line 78 local variable `b` is initialized to the integer `2`.

On line 80 the `times` method is called on the integer `2`, which defines how many times the block is initially instructed to execute, and passing in the `do..end` block with one block parameter `a`. On line 81 block local variable `a` is assigned to the intger `5`. On line 82, the `puts` method is invoked and passed in the value referenced by block local variable `a`, so the code outputs the string representation of the integer `5` and `5`.

On line 85 the `puts` method is invoked and passed in the value referenced by local variable `a`. This outputs the string representation of integer `4` and returns `nil`. The output of the `puts` method on line 85 is not the same as that on line 82 because of variable shadowing. Finally, on line 86, the `puts` method is invoked and passed in the value referenced by local variable `b`. This outputs the string representation of integer `2` and returns `nil`.

This code snippet demonstrates the concept of variable shadowing: When a block parameter (captured between the `||` symbols) has the same variable name as a variable in the outer scope, you now have two local variables in the inner scope with the same name. This is called variable shadowing and PREVENTS access to the outer scope local variable.

Our predict_weather method should output a message indicating whether a sunny or cloudy day lies ahead. However, the output is the same every time the method is invoked. Why? Fix the code so that it behaves as expected.

def predict_weather
  sunshine = ['true', 'false'].sample # changed the objects to booleans

  if sunshine
    puts "Today's weather will be sunny!"
  else
    puts "Today's weather will be cloudy!"
  end
end

On lines 5 through 13, the method `predict_weather` is defined with no parameters. On line 6, the `#sample` method is called on the array object containing 2 string objects as elements; `true` and `false`. The sample method will randomly return one of the two string objects each time it is called. The method local variable `sunshine` is initialized and assigned the return value of the `#sample` call.

On lines 8 to 12 an if conditional statement is defined. If the expression in the `if` branch returns a truthy value, then the code within that branch will be executed. If the expression returns a falsy value, the code within the `else` branch is executed.

The code in its current state will always execute the `if` branch of the `if` conditional statement. Within Ruby, every expression accept for `false` and `nil` are truthy values. The method local variable `sample` will contain a string object of either `true` or `false`, both of which are truthy values. To correct the code, the array on line 6 that `#sample` is called on, should be changed to use boolean `true` and `false` values instead. Here is the resulting code:
